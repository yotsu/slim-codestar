Welcome to the AWS CodeStar sample web service
==============================================

This sample code helps get you started with a simple PHP Slim web
service deployed by AWS CodeDeploy to an Amazon EC2 server.

What's Here
-----------

This sample includes:

* README.md - this file
* appspec.yml - this file is used by AWS CodeDeploy when deploying the web
  service to EC2
* index.php - this file contains the sample service
* scripts/ - this directory contains scripts used by AWS CodeDeploy when
  installing and deploying your service on the Amazon EC2 instance


Getting Started
---------------

These directions assume you want to develop on your local computer, and not
from the Amazon EC2 instance itself. If you're on the Amazon EC2 instance, the
virtual environment is already set up for you, and you can start working on the
code.

To work on the sample code, you'll need to clone your project's repository to your
local computer. If you haven't, do that first. You can find instructions in the
AWS CodeStar user guide.

1. Install PHP.  See http://php.net/manual/en/install.php for details.

2. Install composer.  See https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md for
   details.

3. Install your dependencies:

        $ php composer.phar require slim/slim "^3.0"

4. Start the PHP development server:

        $ php -S localhost:8888 -t public index.php

5. Open http://127.0.0.1:8888/ in a web browser to view your service.

What Do I Do Next?
------------------

Once you have a virtual environment running, you can start making changes to
the sample PHP web service. We suggest making a small change to index.php
first, so you can see how changes pushed to your project's repository are automatically
picked up by your project pipeline and deployed to the Amazon EC2 instance. (You can
watch the pipeline progress on your project dashboard.) Once you've seen how that works,
start developing your own code, and have fun!
